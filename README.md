# JAWS-Training:

The purpose of this project is to provide examples of "accessible" and
"inaccessible" html to illustrate to someone using a screen reader
(specificaly JAWS) how to validate a web page for accessibility.

The concepts for this application are loosely taken from the w3.org's <a
href="https://w3.org/demos/bad.html" target="_blank">WAI Before and After
Demo</a>.

The pieces of the application will be explained in more depth in the
[[doc/contents.md]](Contents) documents.
