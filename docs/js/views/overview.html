			Training Overview

  <div>
  <p>Welcome to the JAWS Labtrainingte.</p>
  <br/>
  <h3>Objectives:</h3>
  <p>There are several primary objectives for this OracleJET web
  application:</p>
  <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Provide an area to practice using JAWS to navigate and interact with a web application.</li>
  <li>Provide examples of inaccessible code and contrast it with the same code
  coded to be accessible.</li>
  <li>Provide instructions on how to use JAWS to validate the accessibility of a web page.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
 <br/>
 <h3>Requirements:</h3>
 <br/>
 <p>It is strongly reccomended that a full-sized keyboard be used while following this training and while performing JAWS accessibility validation. The reason for this is that many JAWS specific functions rely on the numeric pad on a full-sized keyboard.</p>
 <br/>

	<p>When you are told to enter numbers, the numbers are those along the top of the alphanumeric portion of the keyboard. When you are told to use the arrow keys, they are the  keys located in an inverted "T" shape just right of the main keyboard, and when specific "JAWS" keys are mentioned they are located in the numeric pad as discussed below.</p>

		<br/>
		<p>On the numeric pad (numpad) the most important keys for use with JAWS are explained below:</p>
		<dl>
		<dd>JAWSKEY or insert key (terms used interchangeably throughout this training)</dd>
		<dt>This is the long horizontal key on the lower left corner of the numpad.
			It is used to modify other keys to perform various JAWS functions.
		</dt>
			<dd>PC Cursor Key</dd>
			<dt>This is  the long vertical key in the middle along the right side of the numpad. This key is used to switch JAWS into PC Cursor Mode which is the normal mode where JAWS follows the insertion point rather than the mouse cursor. This key is also used to exit FORMS mode as discussed in lesson 2.</dt>
			<dd>JAWS Cursor Key</dd>
			<dt>This is the key in the top right corner of the keypad. It is used to switch JAWS into JAWS mode where the JAWS speech follows the mouse pointer rather than the insertion point. We do not use this mode specifically in this training but the key was included for completeness.</dt>
	</dl>

			<h3>Special Notes:</h3>
			<br/>
			<ol>
					<li>From here on, NO MOUSE is allowed!</li>
					<li>Whenever JAWS is being used, the numlock key *MUST* be
					 turned off so that the JAWS functions can be accessed using
					 the numpad.</li>
					<li>NOTE 2: Because JAWS reads web pages into a virtual
					buffer and works on that buffer, What you see is not always
					what you get. Sometimes JAWS is operating on a part of the
					page that is not visible, so it is best to rely on JAWS and
					to turn off  the display altogether.</li>
			</ol>
