## Testing Links:

This page with its two tabbed pannels will illustrate good nad bad practices
for how to name links and  how links should be identified.

In addition, some links will be provided that are not completely keyboard
operable to illustrate why care needs to be taken to use HTML symantic links
rather than the ARIA link role.
